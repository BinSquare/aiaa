The journey of attempting to build and develop a drone for the UAV competition has been a rewarding learning experience. There is no better way to learn than to make mistakes and by that metric, the UAV team has learned a great deal. 

Although the our team did not win in the competition, the experience of seeing all the other team's builds has been eye-opening. Congratulations to the Israel Institute of Technology and Cornell for coming in first and second place respectively - and best wishes for next year to all of the competing teams!
