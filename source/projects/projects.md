The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Project was started at IIT in the form of an IPRO in Fall 2010 to build a UAV with target detection capabilities with the goal of participating in the annual AUVSI competition.

This project has since been continued by the AIAA-IIT student branch with the same goal in mind. The project is divided into three subteams that focus on one of the three primary aspects of the project each.
